# KegeratorUmbrella

Kegerator is a Nerves based project which uses a Raspberry Pi 3,
a DHT22 Sensor connected on pin 4 and a beefy relay connected on
pin 5. The custom system enabled the DHT11/22 kernel module and
applies the one wire overlay for pin 4.

See `Kegerator.Temperature` for more about how to poll this sensor.
